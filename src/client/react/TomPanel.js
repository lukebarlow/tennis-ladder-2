             It is with great sadness that we mark the death
             of our friend and great tennis player Tom. Thanks for all
            the happy hours on the courts.

            We will be organising a doubles tennis tournament on a Sunday
            around Tom's birthday in May 2021. All those interested please

          <p><u>The Bastard Slice</u></p>
          <p>
          Tennis first, music second, that's what happened. We met as two parts
          of a collection of mostly weird music people formed into a ladder.
          Tom was one of the ones I'd look most forward to playing with. Him tall,
          me small and with differing styles, we often had long rallies both enjoying
          the sense of ridiculousness and intensity that long rallies possess.
          Of course we both had the ability to magnificently crumble at any minute,
          predominantly as a result of the raging post-tour hangover but I shall remember
          the epic contests, both of us aghast, both smiling, all of which now will be
          hugely missed. I'll even miss The Bastard Slice Tom had in his game, given his
          height he could manage this darting forehand that came low over the net,
          angled like a seesaw from his racquet to even lower on my side, it was hard,
          fast and hit with such malevolent glee, the backspin being the final insult
          by keeping the bounce at an all time low and rendering it completely
          impossible to return. The joy and satisfaction in his face at one point gained
          in such a disdainful fashion was always evident in his grin having brutally
          achieved it. Luckily for me, The Bastard Slice could only happen when the
          stars aligned but it certainly reared its ugly head enough for it to
          become a noted thing to try and avoid gifting Tom a point and in â€‹that
          manner. Luckily we could talk openly about our mental frailties and
          demons and not just at the net when swapping ends. Also in the car
          touring the whole of Europe, in the pub, in the Bunker, wherever really,
          not always but you knew the mega deep and meaningful chat was possible and
          indeed happened many times.

          Tom, always thinking, always doing had a lot to say on all aspects
          of life, one which he himself lived to the fullest and which was
          manifest in his wealth of knowledge and desire to do more. We
          had a failed band moment which we overcame via The Oscillation
          where for four years we drove across the continent playing shows
          at all kinds of venues in all kinds of towns. You really get to
          know someone in this context, some of it said, some of it not
          needing to. Music gives so much more than what you hear as its
          end result, it tells you a story of personality, one without words.
          When young children become friends without any judgement of the other
          and before mostly staying with their own kind as adults, there's a
          purity of humanity that we should all strive to sustain. Music offers
          something akin, when you first play together you get an immediate
          sense of the other person and a deep connection can be felt off the
          bat, a direct and innocent understanding of which you know in that
          instant if a relationship can work and whether it's worth pursuing
          the potential future explorations and exchanges. You get a sense of
          the real person therefore and all before you get to then know them.
          As I said we had a failed attempt at a band and it wasn't an easy
          moment but Tom persevered and suggested me to be the next drummer
          for The Oscillation, which at the time was both surprising and exciting
          to be asked and in accepting I gained two great friends as a result.
          The character and musical connection had been set before words got in
          the way and even though that first project didn't work out we came back
          to each other first with The Oscillation and second with what was hoped
          to be a new band launched this year with Tom very present and central
          to it, Melos Kalpa. It is with great sadness to know he will not be
          with us any longer.

          <p>Sharing a stage, sharing a court, sharing a laugh; exchanging music,
            tennis shots and ideas are all things that are way too soon to end
            but at least I had the chance to live them with Tom. I'll
            remember the smile and the just getting stuck in with a profound
            fondness and even if I don't face The Bastard Slice again and the
            joy it gave Tom, the pleasure was all mine.
          </p>
          <p>Lots of love brother, Jem x</p>
